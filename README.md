# Systematic Comparison of Mendelian Randomization Methods

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a code sample for a project aimed at evaluating and comparing different Mendelian Randomization (MR) methods using individual-level or summary statistics from GWAS. The project includes simulations to evaluate the performance of a distinct set of MR methods under diverse scenarios, including common and extreme conditions such as weak instruments, linkage disequilibrium, and pleiotropy.

### Goals

- Simulate data from scratch.
- Calculate the estimated MR effects.
- Compare the performance of various MR and PRS methods under different conditions.

### Methods

The MR methods evaluated include:
- `mr_sisVIVE`
- `mr_2SLS`
- `mr_ivw`
- `mr_median`
- `mr_mode`
- `mr_mix`
- `mr_egger`
- `mr_raps`

The PRS Methods used:
- `PRS_PT`
- `PRS_Oracle`
- `PRS_LDPred`

The calculated PRS is used as the independent instrumental variable (IV) for Mendelian Randomization.

## Noted
In a practical project, approximately ten scripts would execute concurrently due to the large scale of the process. This GitHub repository serves as a code sample and contains a subset of scripts intended to illustrate the overall workflow. The full codebase would be considerably larger than the example provided here.
